1. streamlit==1.30.0
Why?
This is the framework you used to build the app.
It handles everything in your UI: text input, buttons, sidebar, file upload, and layout.
Functions used: st.text_area(), st.button(), st.file_uploader(), st.sidebar, st.session_state, etc.
- Without Streamlit, your app won’t run at all.

2. transformers==4.40.0 
Why?
Comes from Hugging Face – gives you the pipeline() function.
You used it to load the zero-shot-classification model:
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
It handles AI predictions (like labeling text as fake or real).
- Without this, your AI classifier won’t work.

3. torch==2.2.0
Why?
PyTorch is the backend engine used by many Hugging Face models.
When you load models like facebook/bart-large-mnli, it uses PyTorch to run them under the hood.
Even if you didn’t import torch directly, it’s required to run the model.
- If you skip torch, your model will throw errors or refuse to load.

4. pandas==2.2.2
 Why?
You use pandas to store past predictions, create dataframes, and export logs to CSV:
df = pd.DataFrame(st.session_state.log)
df.to_csv("log.csv", index=False)
- Without pandas, log download and history won't work.

5. scikit-learn==1.4.2
Why?
Required internally by transformers for the classification pipeline.
You’re using a zero-shot classifier, which internally depends on some scikit-learn functionalities.
You may not be using sklearn directly, but it’s still a mandatory dependency for text classification tasks.
- If this is missing, transformers may raise errors during model predictions.
